I started studying simulation of moving agents ten years ago and I have come to realize that regular 2D Grids are extraordinary abstractions for the navigable space. In fact, regular 2D grids are very easy to encode and they offer an elegant framework for path planning and collision avoidance algorithms deployment.

In this project, I am sharing an *object oriented architecture* - with its C++ implementation -  that I am actually using in my personal projects when I need a 2D Grid. I hope that it could be an affordable starting point for anyone who is interested in the subject.
